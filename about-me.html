                    <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life </h2>
                    <p>
                        I used to be a park rat. I had so many things i thought i loved. 
                        But the truth was that I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was to much.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Things were terrible. I had a job I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, 
                        and I couldn't hold a relationship.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was on verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. 
                        I lterally put 90% of all my belongings in the garbage,
                        sold my place and OI moved into a smaller apartment,
                        and I quit my job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in a bad place,
                        I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better.
                        I'm less stressed., enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I have no choice but to 
                        start sharing how i did it, and how others can benefit from living the simple life as well,
                        which is why I started this site!
